            <p>
              I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree from the Philippines and my profession has brought me to Canada. 
            </p>
            <p>
              My recent work project was an enterprise-scoped initiative improving the company's security posture and my culmination of skills and experience, namely in technical design and architecture, project management and research and development, has led the project to success. 
            </p>
            <p>
              While some of the technologies used were unfamiliar, it did not hinder me from learning and adopting them. The learning skills that I developed through the years has bridged the gaps and made me a better professional each time.
